```{python}
import pandas as pd 
import numpy as np
import sqlite3
from lets_plot import *

LetsPlot.setup_html(isolated_frame=True)
```


```{python}
# Learn morea about Code Cells: https://quarto.org/docs/reference/cells/cells-jupyter.html

# Include and execute your code here
sqlite_file = 'lahmansbaseballdb.sqlite'
# this file must be in the same location as your .qmd or .py file
con = sqlite3.connect(sqlite_file)
```


## Question 1

__Write an SQL query that pulls in the the salaries table and the collegeplaying table (and any other tables you might need) and store them in pandas dataframes. Combine the dataframes to create a list of baseball players who attended BYU-Idaho. The new table should contain five columns: playerID, schoolID, salary, and the yearID/teamID associated with each salary. Print out the table in your report.__

_Describe your results and analysis here_

<!-- The code chunk below can get you going, you may want to write additional code before or after it. -->

```{python}
# Include and execute your code here
q1 = """SELECT *
        FROM salaries
    """
salaries = pd.read_sql_query(q1, con)

q2 = """SELECT *
        FROM collegeplaying
    """
college = pd.read_sql_query(q2, con)

# Now complete the rest of the task with python (e.g. pandas) code

```

## Question 2

__Pick any two baseball teams and compare them using a metric of your choice (average salary, home runs, number of wins, etc). Be creative! Write an SQL query to read in the tables you need (similar to the tasks above), then use pandas to manipulate the data. Finally, make a graph using Lets-Plot to visualize the comparison. What do you learn?__
